<p>I am a research software engineer, with a background in astrophysics.
 I use my skills to help researchers solve their software problems, by
implementing algorithms, improving their code or setting up the
environment for running software. I also teach scientists best software
practices, such as versioning and continuous integration. My ideal work
environment is a small-sized scientific institute, where one-on-one
interaction with the researchers is quick and easy.</p>

<p>I prefer pragmatic solutions to a problem, making use of existing
(software) tools, instead of reinventing a wheel. Once in place, I can
enjoy tweaking such a wheel for further optimisations. For more
difficult problems that do require new solutions (e.g., new software), I
 like to explore various solutions. Most of the time, I will try and
solve the core of the problem, so that some initial results are
available for feedback; this first solution will generally be flexible
that the details are easy to change and optimise for the problem at
hand.</p>

<p>Ideally, I help researchers improve their software needed to solve
their specific problems. In particular, I can help researchers that are
not familiar with the various possibilities that the right software,
library or language offers, by either assisting them directly or point
them to people or institutes that can help them further.</p>

<p>I like to work independently, with feedback from small groups. I am
also used to working in large collaborations, albeit that most of the
time, the actual work is of course still done with a small working
group. When solving a problem, I prefer first to think a topic over; at
times with a bit of experimenting in between, to see which direction a
solution should take.</p>

<p>I also like to provide training for local groups, through the means
of small courses that would cover topics such as programming languages
(introductory or advanced), software tools (versioning software, good
shell use), good software practices (testing, continuous integration),
or FAIR software (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).
Such a course could take one day, or a few hours a week for several
weeks, and aimed at both scientists and students alike. Such courses
would be done in the style of the Software Carpentry.</p>
