I am a research software engineer, with a background in astrophysics. I use my skills to help researchers solve their software problems, by implementing algorithms, improving their code or setting up the environment for running software. I also teach scientists best software practices, such as versioning and continuous integration. My ideal work environment is a small-sized scientific institute, where one-on-one interaction with the researchers is quick and easy.


I prefer pragmatic solutions to a problem, making use of existing (software) tools, instead of reinventing a wheel. Once in place, I can enjoy tweaking such a wheel for further optimisations. For more difficult problems that do require new solutions (e.g., new software), I like to explore various solutions. Most of the time, I will try and solve the core of the problem, so that some initial results are available for feedback; this first solution will generally be flexible that the details are easy to change and optimise for the problem at hand.

Ideally, I help researchers improve their software needed to solve their specific problems. In particular, I can help researchers that are not familiar with the various possibilities that the right software, library or language offers, by either assisting them directly or point them to people or institutes that can help them further.

I like to work independently, with feedback from small groups. I am also used to working in large collaborations, albeit that most of the time, the actual work is of course still done with a small working group. When solving a problem, I prefer first to think a topic over; at times with a bit of experimenting in between, to see which direction a solution should take.


I also like to provide training for local groups, through the means of small courses that would cover topics such as programming languages (introductory or advanced), software tools (versioning software, good shell use), good software practices (testing, continuous integration), or FAIR software (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). Such a course could take one day, or a few hours a week for several weeks, and aimed at both scientists and students alike. Such courses would be done in the style of the Software Carpentry.
